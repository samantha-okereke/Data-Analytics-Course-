#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify customer and order data statistics. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'ORDER ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product= "iPhone"
AND length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'ORDER ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February. 
SELECT distinct cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id= Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select 
SELECT product,sum(quantity), SUM(quantity)* price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
